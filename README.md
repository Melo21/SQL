# SQL Problem Solving
1. Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
```
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```

Solution:
```
Delete p from Person p
where p.ID not in 
(Select ID from (select min(Person.id) as ID from person group by Person.email) as tobeDel)
```

2. Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.

For example:
```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```
After running your query, the above salary table should have the following rows:
```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```
Solution:

update salary set sex = IF(sex = 'm','f','m')


3. Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.</h1>
```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```
