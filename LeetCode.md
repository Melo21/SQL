# SQL Problem Solving
1. Duplicate Emails 
Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
```
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```

**Solution:**
```
Delete p from Person p
where p.ID not in 
(Select ID from (select min(Person.id) as ID from person group by Person.email) as tobeDel)
```

2. Swap Salary

Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.

For example:
```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
```
After running your query, the above salary table should have the following rows:
```
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
```
**Solution:**

Update salary set sex = IF(sex = 'm','f','m')

3. 	Employees Earning More Than Their Managers   

The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```
**Solution**
```
Select emp.NAME from 
(select managerid,name,salary from employee where managerid is not null) as emp 
left join
(select id,name,salary from employee where managerid is null) as boss 
on emp.managerid = boss.id
where emp.salary > boss.salary
```

4. Nth Highest Salary   

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.</h1>
```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```
